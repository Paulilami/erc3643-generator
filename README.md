Sub-project of the Trusset protocol for public demo purposes. Deploy your own erc3643 contracts and create your tokens, for free.

Pleas enote: Solana and Base use nearly 1:1 the same contracts, Solana contracts (rust) differ more heavily yet it provides the same capabilities on all 3 chains. 

On Solana, the tokens use SPL Token-2022 with Transfer Hooks and the Solana Attestation Service (SAS) for built-in compliance and identity verification.
